	```

1.  At the end of the **Main** method and before the closing parenthesis, add the following code:

	```
	table.CreateIfNotExists();
	```

1.  In the **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click the **Contoso.Storage.Table** project, point to **Add**, and then click **New Item**.

1.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, perform the following steps:

	b.  Click the **Class** template.

	c.  In the **Name** box, type **Employee.cs**.

	d.  Click **Add**.

1.  In the **Employee** class, add the **public** accessor at the left side of the class definition:

	```
	class Employee
	```

1.  Verify that the updated class definition reads as follows:

	```
	public class Employee
	```

1.  Add the following **using** statement at the top of the code file:

	```
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table;
	```

1.  In the **Employee** class, add the **inheritance** statement **: TableEntity** at the right side of the class definition:

	```
	public class Employee
	```

1.  Verify that the updated class definition reads as follows:

	```
	public class Employee : TableEntity
	```

1.  Within the **Employee** class, add the following line of code:

	```
	public int YearsAtCompany { get; set; }
	```

1.  Within the **Employee** class, add the following method:

	```
	public override string ToString()
  {

  }
  ```

1.  Within the **ToString** method, add the following line of code:

	```
	return RowKey + "\t\t[" + YearsAtCompany + "]";
	```

1.  In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **Contoso.Storage.Table** project.

1.  Double-click the **Program.cs** file.

1.  At the end of the **Main** method and before the closing parenthesis, add the first Employee with a partition key of **IT** as shown below:

	```
	Employee first = new Employee { PartitionKey = "IT", RowKey = "ibahena", YearsAtCompany = 7 };
	```

1.  Add a second employee with a partition key of **HR**, as shown below:

	```
	Employee second = new Employee { PartitionKey = "HR", RowKey = "rreeves", YearsAtCompany = 12 };
	```

1.  Add a third employee with a partition key of **HR**, as shown below:

	```
	Employee third = new Employee { PartitionKey = "HR", RowKey = "rromani", YearsAtCompany = 3 };
	```

1.  At the end of the **Main** method and before the closing parenthesis, create a new **TableOperation** that inserts the first Employee as shown below:

	```
	TableOperation insertOperation = TableOperation.InsertOrReplace(first);
	```

1.  On the next line, use the **Execute** method on the table variable to execute the **TableOperation**, as shown below:

	```
	table.Execute(insertOperation);
	```

1.  At the end of the **Main** method and before the closing parenthesis, create a new **TableBatchOperation** with the following code:

	```
	TableBatchOperation batchOperation = new TableBatchOperation();
	```

1.  On the next line, add an **InsertOrReplace** operation to the batch for the second Employee, as shown below:

	```
	batchOperation.InsertOrReplace(second);
	```

1.  On the next line, add an **InsertOrReplace** operation to the batch for the third Employee, as shown below:

	```
	batchOperation.InsertOrReplace(third);
	```

1.  On the next line, use the **ExecuteBatch** method on the table variable to execute the **TableBatchOperation**, as shown below:

	```
	table.ExecuteBatch(batchOperation);
	```

1.  At the end of the **Main** method and before the closing parenthesis, create a string filter to retrieve only entities with a partition key of **HR** by using the **TableQuery.GenerateFilterCondition** static method:

	```
	string queryFilter = TableQuery.GenerateFilterCondition("PartitionKey", QueryComparisons.Equal, "HR");
	```

1.  On the next line, create a new **TableQuery** and invoke the **Where** method by using the string filter, as shown below:

	```
	TableQuery<Employee> query = new TableQuery<Employee>().Where(queryFilter);
	```

1.  On the next line, write a header to the Console window, as shown below:

	```
	Console.WriteLine("HR Employees\n");
	```

1.  On the next line, use a **foreach** loop to iterate over the results of the query, as shown below:

	```
	foreach (Employee hrEmployee in table.ExecuteQuery<Employee>(query))
  {

  }
  ```

1.  Within the loop, write the **Employee** object to the Console window, as shown below:

	```
	Console.WriteLine(hrEmployee);
	```

1.  At the end of the main method and before the closing parenthesis, write a header to the Console window:

	```
	Console.WriteLine("\n\n\n\nIT Employee\n");
	```

1.  On the next line, create a new **TableOperation** to retrieve the single entity with a partition key of **IT** and row key of **ibahena**:

	```
	TableOperation retrieveOperation = TableOperation.Retrieve<Employee>("IT", "ibahena");
	```

1.  On the next line, execute the **TableOperation** by using the **Execute** method of the table variable and store the result in a *TableResult* variable, as shown below:

	```
	TableResult result = table.Execute(retrieveOperation);
	```

1.  On the next line, cast the **Result** property of the *TableResult* variable to an **Employee** object, as shown below:

	```
	Employee itEmployee = (Employee)result.Result;
	```

1.  On the next line, write the **Employee** object to the Console window, as shown below:

	```
	Console.WriteLine(itEmployee);
	```

1.  On the Start screen, click the **Internet Explorer** tile.

1.	In the *Address bar* navigate to the following address:
