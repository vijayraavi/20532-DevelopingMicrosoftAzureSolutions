# Module 8: Designing a Communication Strategy by Using Queues and Service Bus

# Lab: Using Queues and Service Bus to Manage Communication Between Web Applications in Azure

## Exercise 1: Creating an Azure Service Bus Namespace

#### Task 1: Create the Service Bus namespace by using the Portal

> **Note:** Service Bus functionality is not available yet in the new Portal. Because of this, the Classic Portal will be used for this lab.

1. On the Start screen, click the **Internet Explorer** tile.

1. Go to [*https://portal.azure.com*](https://portal.azure.com)

1. In the email address box, type the email address of your Microsoft account.

1. In the password box, type the password for your Microsoft account.

1. Click **Sign In** In the navigation pane on the left side

1. In the navigation pane on the left side of the screen, scroll down, and then click **Service Bus**.

1. At the bottom of the screen, click the **Create** button.

1. In the **Create a Namespace** dialog box, perform the following steps:

  a. In the **Namespace Name** box, type **sb20532[*Your Name*]**.

  b. In the **Region** list, select the region that is closest to your location.

  c. In the **Type** list, select the **Messaging** option.

  d. In the **Messaging Tier** list, select the **Standard** option.

  e. Click the check mark button to create your namespace.

  > **Note:** It takes approximately 1-2 minutes to create your Service Bus namespace instance.

1. In the list of **Service Bus** namespaces, click the namespace that you just created.

1. At the bottom of the screen, click **Connection Information**.

1. Record the *RootManageSharedAccessKey* connection string from the **Access connection information** dialog box.

  > **Note:** You must record a connection string from the list of SAS items.

1. Close the **Access connection information** dialog box.

1. At the top of the screen, click the **Queues** tab.

1. At the bottom-left corner of the screen, click **New**.

1. If it is not automatically selected, select **App Services > Service Bus > Queue > Custom Create**.

1. In the **Create a Queue** dialog box, perform the following steps:

  a. In the **Queue** **Name** box, type **signin**.

  b. In the **Region** list, select the same region that you selected for the namespace.

  c. In the **Namespace** box, provide the value **sb20532[Your Name]**.

  d. Click next arrow to move to the next step in the wizard.

  e. Leave all fields as their default values.

  f. Click the check mark button to create the new queue.

> **Results:** After completing this exercise, you will have created a Service Bus namespace and queue by using the Portal.
